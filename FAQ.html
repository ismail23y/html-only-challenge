            <summary>What is <strong>COVID-19</strong>?</summary>
            <p><strong>COVID-19</strong> is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have <strong>COVID-19</strong> have mild symptoms, <strong>COVID-19</strong> can also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.</p>
        </details>
        <br>
        <details>
            <summary>How does the virus spread?</summary>
            <p><strong>COVID-19</strong> is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with <strong>COVID-19</strong>  have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes. </p>
            <p><strong>COVID-19</strong> spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes <strong>COVID-19</strong> appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.</p>

            <summary>What should I do if I had close contact with someone who has tested positive for <strong>COVID-19</strong>?</summary>
            <p>The best way to protect yourself and others is to stay home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has <strong>COVID-19</strong>. Check your local health department’s website for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period.</p>
            <p>Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of <strong>COVID-19</strong>.</p>
            <p>If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from <strong>COVID-19</strong>.</p>

            <summary>Should children wear masks?</summary>
            <p>In general, children 2 years and older should wear a mask. Masks offer some protection to you and are also meant to protect those around you, in case you are unknowingly infected with the virus that causes <strong>COVID-19</strong>. However, CDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. Appropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some children, such as children with certain disabilities, including cognitive, intellectual, developmental, sensory and behavioral disorders. Learn more about what you should do if your child or you cannot wear masks in certain situations.</p>

            <summary>When should I seek emergency care if I have <strong>COVID-19</strong>?</summary>
            <p>Look for emergency warning signs* for <strong>COVID-19</strong>. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trouble breathing</li>
                <li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>
                <li>New confusion</li>
                <li>Inability to wake or stay awake</li>
                <li>Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Call 8335 or call ahead to your local emergency facility</strong>: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have <strong>COVID-19</strong>.</p>
