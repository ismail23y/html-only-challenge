        <p>While fewer children have been sick with <strong>COVID-19</strong> compared to adults, children can be infected with the virus that causes <strong>COVID-19</strong>, can get sick from <strong>COVID-19</strong>, and can spread the virus that causes <strong>COVID-19</strong> to others. Children, like adults, who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms (“asymptomatic”) can still spread the virus to others.</p>
        <p>Most children with <strong>COVID-19</strong> have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all. However, some children can get severely ill from <strong>COVID-19</strong>. They might require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe. In rare cases, they might die.</p>
